gResistor2
============
To allow for identification, resistors are usually marked with colored bands. Often refered to as color codes, these markings are indicative of their resistance, tolerance and temperature coefficient. gResistor2 helps you translate resistor color codes into a readable value and also from a given value to color codes. All you have to do is watch the colors on the resistor and then enter them in the program. As you enter colours you'll see that the resistor value is changing accordingly. Also if you can enter a specific value for a resistor and observe the needed colors for that resistor.

Installation
============

gResistor2 uses Python distutils for installation.
To install gResistor2 you'll need to have root privileges to make this install.
Type 'python setup.py install' in a terminal. 

Run the program
============

To run the program just type 'gresistor2' or click the icon in your favorite DE
